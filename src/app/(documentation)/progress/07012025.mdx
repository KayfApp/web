# Project Report – January 2025  

As we step into the new year, this report marks the first update of 2025. The team has made substantial progress on Tracer while also navigating formal academic requirements. Notable achievements in both technical and presentation areas have set a promising tone for the months ahead.  

1. **Tracer Development:**  
   - The **Tracer API** is now complete, providing a robust foundation for integrations and further development.  
   - Due to a conceptual error, the search mechanism is being re-coded from scratch, ensuring a more reliable and efficient solution.  
   - Workflows now support successful email dispatch, marking a functional milestone.  
   - A rework of the data schema means that Tracer no longer requires continuous 24/7 operation, enhancing efficiency and reducing resource demands.  

2. **Jugend Innovativ Selection:**  
   - We are thrilled to announce that Kayf has been selected for the next round of Jugend Innovativ, reflecting the project’s potential and the team’s hard work.  

3. **Homepage Enhancements:**  
   - The official KayfApp homepage has been significantly improved, featuring a new download page to enhance user accessibility and engagement.  

4. **Academic Commitments:**  
   - Current efforts are focused on formal requirements, including the **State of the Art analysis** and the **feasibility study.** These tasks are critical but will temporarily slow technical progress.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Complete the redesign and implementation of Tracer’s search mechanism.  
- Continue preparations for the upcoming round of Jugend Innovativ.  
- Finalize and publish the feasibility study and State of the Art documentation.  
- Monitor user feedback on the homepage and refine further as needed.
