# Literature Research

With the literature research submission deadline nearing, the team has concentrated primarily on research activities. This intensive focus on scientific literature has deepened our understanding of individual topics and informed several enhancements to the project.

Despite the research emphasis, we achieved significant implementation milestones.  

1. **Tracer - LLM Integration with RAG:**  
   - Tracer has been enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM) integration via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is a cutting-edge approach that combines retrieval systems with generative models, enabling the search mechanism to access external knowledge bases and provide contextually accurate responses.  
   - This integration concept emerged from our literature research. Tracerâ€™s framework has been extended to accommodate RAG adapters, and further exploration of compatible RAG configurations is ongoing.  

2. **BlockSuite Integration:**  
   - Kayf has successfully integrated the BlockSuite library from the platform "Affine" by "toeverything". This tool delivers a seamless editor and canvas integration, enhancing the creativity and user experience for note-writing and editing tasks.  

3. **Kubernetes Setup:**  
   - Tobias Fischinger has applied his newly acquired knowledge to establish a testing environment using Kubernetes. The environment is currently undergoing rigorous testing to ensure its viability for future scalability.  

4. **Security API Enhancements:**  
   - Alexander Awart has extended the security API with a newly developed front-end, improving usability and accessibility for implementation and testing.
